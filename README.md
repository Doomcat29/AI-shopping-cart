# AI-shopping-cart
This project is for IT 254. The idea is to have a camera hooked up to an arduino which is going to run a AI model to check if the basket has anything in it and if it does it attempts to figure out what the item is. After it figures out what the item is it'll tell you the price of the item and make a list of the items in the cart.
